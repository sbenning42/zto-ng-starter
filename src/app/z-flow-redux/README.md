# ZTO Flow Redux

  

# Disclamer

  

You can use/extend/drop that library as you want for whatewer reasons it suits you .

  

If you feel like injuring or giving credits, I'm 42B .

  

If you'r already bored about reading the README,

but anyway want to use the library,

jump to the Technicals.

  
**TLDR**: give you some tools to **Model** the **State** of your application, and allow it's **data** to fluently link what **User** wants to do, wants to see, to rather synchronous, rather asynchronous complex tasks graph.
> Paradigm Shift
Once upon a time a dev really wanted to build beautifull **Frontent User Interface**.
He follow the hipe, learned the **MVC pattern**, and the Angular/Ionic
best practices to assemble the parts.
All Was for the best. The dev was happy. The boss made money.
But here comes the first beast: **Fast Scale**.
The poor dev *thanks to **Fast Scale***, realizes that he misunderstood **MVC** and had actualy
built a **(W***ithout***M)VC** structure.
In **MVC**, **M** stand for **Model**, and he thought that **Models** were just some interfaces
that he coulds use to represent in his poor human brain the bits of the **data**...
Well, an **MVC** needs it's **Model** to manage **data**.
**data** is were money comes from. The dev needs money! He wants money anyway!
A **Frontent User Interface** is a complexe state machine where **data** should fluently flows.
But here comes the second beast. **User**.
**User** is no fluent!
He's unpredictable that \*f\*\*\*ing bastard!
To dompt what **User** wanted to do with **data**, the dev listens to it's stranges gurus on the Internet
And he decides to Apply what **Ben Lesh**, **John Papa**, **Raznick**, **Todd Moto** and comparse had all to say
about building beautifull **Frontent User Interface**.
# Better Tools, Better Power !!!
> With it's new **@ngrx/store** and **@ngrx/effects**, he tackles down some POCs for weeks.
But something was wrong, **@ngrx/effects** was great, but even after the dev bought
the adviced by **** book called **Entreprise Integration Patterns** and he had kind of learned
it's content (reading it 5 times ... It's a big book ... Feels bad man ...), the dev still
was doupting about the low-levelness of *correlationId* and *SequencedMessage* Patterns.
But anyway **@ngrx/store** was a revolution in his mind. It's bringing back the beauty of the **M** of 
**MVC**.
Anyway the last beasts that were **Asynchronous**, **Third party APIs**, **Plugins**, all needed
their food to keep calm...
So the dev hasardly read about Python's **TaskFlow** Pattern.
And he decides to follow that light and gives it's own Typescript version a life, that will **link** the **Redux Store** to a **Sync/Async tasks graph executor**.
That what ZTO Flow Redux is about:

>*Give you some tools to **Model** the **State** of your application, and allow it's **data** to fluently link what **User** wahnts to do, wants to see, to rather synchronous, rather asynchronous sources assembled in some complex reusable tasks graphs.*
